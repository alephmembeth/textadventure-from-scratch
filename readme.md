# Textadventure from Scratch

Here, using the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine) (version 4.0.1), a small textadventure is being developed from scratch.

Following Joe Bustamanteâ€™s [tutorial](https://github.com/josephmbustamante/godot-text-adventure-tutorial), the below-listed features were implemented first:

- [x] list available commands with a `help` command
- [x] move between areas with a `go` command
- [x] handle items with `take`, `drop`, `give`, and `inventory` commands
- [x] prevent player from entering locked areas
- [x] use items to unlock locked areas with a `use` command
- [x] talk to characters with a `talk` command
- [x] give player quest rewards

Thereafter, the following features were added:
- [x] exit the game with a `quit` command
